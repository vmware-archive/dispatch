# v0.1.22 Dispatch Release

[Download v0.1.22](https://github.com/vmware/dispatch/releases/tag/v0.1.22)


### Fix dispatch uninstall cmd ignoring config file

`dispatch uninstall` cmd now respects the namespace definition in the config file.


### Bump version of PhotonOS in our images

An ancient version of PhotonOS image was used. Updated to `vmware/photon2:20180620`.


### Move source code out of function entity

Function entity used to hold the .tar.gz archive of the source code folder (or file) from which the function was built.

API and CLI to create a function has not changed. When getting a function, `source` field is no longer returned back in the response. The reason is: once the function has been built, the resulting artifact is the function image, and the source is no longer used.
