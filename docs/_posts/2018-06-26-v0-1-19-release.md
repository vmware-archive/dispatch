# v0.1.19 Dispatch Release

[Download v0.1.19](https://github.com/vmware/dispatch/releases/tag/v0.1.19)


## Support for Exposed Event Driver
Events may now be pushed (as opposed to pulled) from event sources to Dispatch.  An *exposed* driver will create an ingress route and service to recieve events.
When creating event driver type, use `--expose` to create exposed drivers, these drivers will have a URL which events can be pushed to.
```bash
$ dispatch create eventdrivertype ticker vmware/dispatch-ticker-driver:v0.1.0 --expose
```
The `EXPOSE` field of created event driver type should be true:
```bash
$ dispatch get eventdrivertype
 NAME   |                IMAGE                 | EXPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------------
  ticker | vmware/dispatch-ticker-driver:v0.1.0 | true
-----------------------------------------------------------
```
Next, to create exposed driver:
```bash
$ dispatch create eventdriver ticker
Created event driver: correct-walrus-191793
```
And After the driver was created successfully, we should see an URL:
```bash
$ dispatch get eventdriver
          NAME          |  TYPE   | STATUS | SECRETS | CONFIG |                              URL                              | REASON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  correct-walrus-191793 | 2ticker | READY  |         |        | https:///driver/dispatch/4a355304-fa39-4c57-b4b6-6725f5894def |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
and we can push events to this URL which the event driver will receive and process.


## Update to Support Latest Cloud Event Implementation
Dispatch now follows the latest [Cloud Events specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/a12b6b618916c89bfa5595fc76732f07f89219b5/spec.md)). `SourceType` and `EventType` were consolidated into one field, after the change, to add a new subscription for the `vm.being.created` event in a vcenter event driver, run:
```bash
$ dispatch create subscription --event-type vm.being.created myFunction
```
