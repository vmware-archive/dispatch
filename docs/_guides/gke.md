# Setting up Dispatch on GKE

Google Container Engine (GKE) provides fully managed hosted kubernetes clusters.  This is great environment for running
Dispatch, especially if you'd like Dispatch exposed to the internet.

This guide walks through an installation of Dispatch on GKE with certificates and authorization enabled.  It's a good
idea to enable authorization as otherwise the Dispatch API is unprotected and on the internet.  Addtionally, enabling
certificates via letsencrypt enables use-cases which require signed certificates (like slack integrations).

The certificate support is pretty experiemental at this point and requires AWS Route53.  Support for other DNS services
is coming.

## Create GKE cluster

```
export CLUSTER_NAME=dispatch-demo
gcloud container clusters create -m n1-standard-2 --cluster-version 1.9.6-gke.1 ${CLUSTER_NAME}
```

## Fetch cluster credentials

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME}
```

Kubectl should now be configured to the new cluster:

```
$ kubectl config current-context
gke_dispatch-193801_us-west1-c_dispatch-demo
```

## Setup Helm and Tiller

```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
```

The following command it to work around a known [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/3409)
[issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/3379).  If it fails, retry:

```
helm init --tiller-image powerhome/tiller:git-3b22ecd --wait
```

## Create Secret for Route53

If you are enabling certificates (and you are using AWS Route53), create the following secret:

```
kubectl create secret generic route53 --namespace kube-system --from-literal secret-access-key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Dispatch uses letsencrypt and relies on the DNS challenge type for issuing certificates.  This requirement
will hopefully go away in the near future, but is necessary for now.  Also, additional DNS services may be
supported.

## Install Dispatch

Create a installation config as follows, subsituting values where appropriate:

```yaml
ingress:
  serviceType: LoadBalancer
apiGateway:
  serviceType: LoadBalancer
  # A hostname for the API gateway, set this in Route53 when prompted
  host: api-host.example.com
letsEncrypt:
  # An email address where certificate expiration warnings are sent
  email: user@example.com
  # Use letsencrypt prod
  staging: false
  # The AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID associated with the route53 secret set above
  route53:
    accessKeyID: ***********
dispatch:
  # A hostname for the dispatch API, set this in Route53 when prompted
  host: host.example.com
  port: 443
  tls:
    ca: letsEncrypt
  faas: riff
  eventTransport: kafka
  # Bootstrap user should be the email address of the github user assocated
  # with the github app (below).  See the [authorization docs]
  # (https://vmware.github.io/dispatch/documentation/guides/setup-authentication)
  bootstrapUser: user@example.com
  oauth2Proxy:
    provider: github
    clientID: **********
    clientSecret: ***********
```

Run the dispatch install command:

```
$ dispatch install -f gke-install.yaml --single-namespace=dispatch

## Authenticate and Setup User Policies

**Ensure that the configured [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers)
points to the dispatch hostname (i.e. `host.example.com`)**

At this point dispatch is installed, but is in "bootstrap mode".

The following instructions are abbreviated from the
[setup authorization guide](https://vmware.github.io/dispatch/documentation/guides/setup-authentication).
See the guide for more detail and troubleshooting.

1. Log in to dispatch. If everything is setup correctly you should be redirected to github for authentication:
```
dispatch login
```

2. Use the email address associated with your GitHub account to create an iam policy:
```
dispatch iam create policy default-admin-policy --subject github-user@example.com --action "*" --resource "*"
```

3. Validate the policy:
```
$ dispatch iam get policy default-admin-policy --wide
          NAME         |         CREATED DATE         |             RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  default-admin-policy | Sat Jan  1 10:17:16 PST 0000 | {
                       |                              |   "actions": [
                       |                              |     "*"
                       |                              |   ],
                       |                              |   "resources": [
                       |                              |     "*"
                       |                              |   ],
                       |                              |   "subjects": [
                       |                              |     "github-user@example.com"
                       |                              |   ]
                       |                              | }
```

4. Disable bootstrap mode (you will now have full access to the API - according to the configured policy):

```
dispatch manage --disable-bootstrap-mode -f config.yaml
```

> **Important**: You will need to wait up to 30 seconds for change to be applied
