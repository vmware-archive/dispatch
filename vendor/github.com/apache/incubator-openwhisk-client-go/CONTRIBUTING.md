# Contributing to Apache OpenWhisk

Anyone can contribute to the OpenWhisk project and we welcome your contributions.

There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and
contribute code, but you must follow these prerequisites and guidelines:

 - [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement)
 - [Raising issues](#raising-issues)
 - [Coding Standards](#coding-standards)

### Contributor License Agreement

All contributors must sign and submit an Apache CLA (Contributor License Agreement).

Instructions on how to do this can be found here:
[http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas)

Once submitted, you will receive a confirmation email from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and be added to
the following list: http://people.apache.org/unlistedclas.html. 

Project committers will use this list to verify pull requests (PRs) come from contributors that have signed a CLA.

We look forward to your contributions! 

## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports on the respective project repository's GitHub issue tracker. Be sure to search the 
list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. 
Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

### Discussion

Please use the project's developer email list to engage our community:
[dev@openwhisk.incubator.apache.org](dev@openwhisk.incubator.apache.org)

In addition, we provide a "dev" Slack team channel for conversations at:
https://openwhisk-team.slack.com/messages/dev/

### Coding standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used throughout the existing
code base. Some basic rules include:

 - all files must have the Apache license in the header.
 - all PRs must have passing builds for all operating systems.
